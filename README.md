# EdConnect
With 1.2 million dropouts per year in the US alone and 82% of people in jail being high school dropouts, there is no question that students are being left behind in the classroom. As much as 39% of these dropouts were due to failing grades. With EdConnect, teachers are able to grade their students on a more comprehensive level through the use of "attributes," which are skills that teachers feel are the most important to the class. Teachers will be able to easily identify weaknesses and strengths in their students and predict a student's future performance on assignments and tests through the EdConnect algorithm. EdConnect will hold teachers more accountable by giving them all the tools necessary to target student's weaknesses and assist in preparing students for their futures.
